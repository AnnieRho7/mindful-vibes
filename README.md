## Known Bugs and Limitations

During the development and testing phase, a few issues were identified. While these don't significantly impact the core functionality of the blog, they are documented here for transparency and future improvement.

### HTML Validation Error in Sign-Up Page

An unexpected open `<span>` tag appears in the HTML of the sign-up page, causing a validation error. This tag is not present in the custom HTML but seems to be generated by Django's authentication system.

![Sign-up Page HTML Validation Error](./readme-images/bug-1.png)
![Post_detail HTML Validation Error](./readme-images/bug-2.png)

**Impact**: Low - Does not affect functionality but may impact perfect HTML validation scores.

### Post Deletion Redirect

When a user deletes a post from their profile, the page currently redirects back to `view_user_profile.html`. The intended behavior is to redirect to `user_profile.html`.

![Post Deletion Redirect Issue](./readme-images/post-delete.png)

**Impact**: Low - Functionality works, but user experience could be improved.


### Blog Page Responsiveness

The blog page and text overlay have some responsive design limitations, particularly on smaller screen sizes. The text does not scale optimally with the screen size.

![Blog Page Responsiveness Issue](./readme-images/blog-responsiveness.png)

**Impact**: Medium - Affects user experience on mobile devices.

### CSS and Bootstrap Conflicts

There are some inconsistencies between custom CSS and Bootstrap styles, leading to difficulties in overriding certain Bootstrap defaults. This may result in some styling inconsistencies across the site.

**Impact**: Low to Medium - Mostly aesthetic issues, core functionality not affected.

---

These issues have been identified and documented for future iterations of the project. While they do not significantly impact the core functionality of the blog, addressing them would enhance the overall user experience and code quality.


### Possible Future Features

* User profile management and enhanced frontend admin functionality.
* Social login options for Facebook or Google.
* Password recovery options - Allow users to reset their passwords through email or SMS verification.
* Responsive design improvements - Enhance the mobile experience for better usability on different devices.
